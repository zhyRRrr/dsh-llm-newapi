# dsh-llm-newapi

**English** | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

An LLM provider plugin that adds **NewAPI** to [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh). **Zero modifications to dsh itself.**

- Provider route id: `newapi`
- Display name: `NewAPI`
- Shape: LLM Provider plugin — implements the `LlmAdapter` seam from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm`; NewAPI gateway generation can use OpenAI (`POST {baseURL}/chat/completions` or `POST {baseURL}/responses`) or Anthropic Messages (`POST {baseURL}/messages`), with `GET {baseURL}/models` for discovery
- Dual-face structure: host side (adapter + model discovery) + browser side (a "NewAPI" settings page in the dsh web settings panel, including "Fetch model info")

Design decisions and trade-off analysis live in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md); reference implementation: `deepseek-harness/packages/llm/llm-deepseek`.

## Installation (dsh >= 0.1.0-rc)

### Install from this GitHub repository

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:zhyRRrr/dsh-llm-newapi
```

Confirm `dsh-llm-newapi` is present in `dsh.profile.bundles` in the web profile package:

```text
Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.dsh\profiles\web\package.json
Linux/macOS: ~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json
```

Restart dsh web after the install. In Windows Command Prompt:

```bat
for /f "tokens=5" %a in ('netstat -ano ^| findstr :3080 ^| findstr LISTENING') do taskkill /F /PID %a
start "" /b dsh web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 3080
```

### Local development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zhyRRrr/dsh-llm-newapi.git
cd dsh-llm-newapi
npm install
npm run build
npm test
```

In Windows Command Prompt, install a local checkout with an absolute path:

```bat
dsh plugin --profile web add link:E:\EducationApp\dsh-llm-newapi
```

The compiled `lib/` directory is committed because GitHub installs run `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js`. Run `npm run build` before pushing source changes.

> **Missing-peer warnings at install time are expected and can be ignored**: `react`/`cordis`/`dsh-llm`/`dsh-settings`/`schemastery` etc. are provided at runtime by the dsh host app; declaring them as `peerDependencies` is exactly how the plugin says "don't install your own copy". The profile's `autoInstallPeers: false` makes pnpm report them as missing. Every dsh plugin shows this WARN on install (dsh-at-file is the same); installation succeeds regardless. Do not install that list manually or enable autoInstallPeers — it causes duplicate cordis services and the plugin silently failing.

## Web setup

After restarting, open dsh settings and select the **NewAPI** page.

1. Select a saved channel in the top **Channel** dropdown, or click **Add channel**.
2. Enter its API key and paste the gateway base URL, usually ending in `/v1`.
3. The hostname fills Provider ID and Display name automatically; both are editable. Provider IDs use lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-` and must be unique.
4. Select **OpenAI protocol** or **Anthropic protocol**.
5. Under OpenAI choose **Chat Completions** or **Responses**. Under Anthropic choose **Messages**.
6. Click **Fetch models**, select the needed models, then click **Save**.

All saved channels are registered at once, each with separate models, protocol, gateway URL, provider route, and API key.

## YAML configuration

```yaml
- id: llm-newapi
  name: dsh-llm-newapi
  config:
    baseURL: http://gw.local:3000/v1   # include the /v1 prefix; falls back to env NEWAPI_BASE_URL → placeholder
    protocol: responses                 # legacy single-channel form; channels below support multiple gateways
    # channels:                        # each channel registers its own provider route and credential
    #   - provider: x-ailzd-com         # optional; defaults from the gateway hostname
    #     displayName: x.ailzd.com       # optional; defaults to the gateway hostname
    #     baseURL: https://x.ailzd.com/v1
    #     protocol: responses            # chat-completions, responses, or anthropic-messages
    #   - baseURL: https://api.example.com/v1  # provider becomes api-example-com
    # models:                          # suggested catalog; empty by default, use "Fetch model info" to pull /models
    #   - id: deepseek-chat
    #     contextWindow: 65536
    #     input: [text, image]           # optional; declare vision support explicitly
    # modelExcludePatterns:            # chat-only filter during discovery (replaces the default wholesale)
    #   - embed                        #   default ['embed','rerank','ranker'] (case-insensitive id substring)
    #   - rerank                       #   set [] to disable the filter; multi-capability ids (bge-m3) must be added manually
    # defaultContextWindow: 128000     # context capacity when the catalog has no entry
    # maxTokens: 8192                  # when absent, max_tokens is not sent and each upstream default applies
    # providerHints:                   # official-vendor arbitration for models.dev parameter matching
    #   defaults:                      #   family prefix → provider (overrides built-ins like glm→zai)
    #     glm: zhipuai                 #   e.g. use the ZhipuAI open platform data instead
    #   models:                        #   per-id exact → provider (takes precedence over family)
    #     tencent/Hunyuan-MT-7B: nano-gpt
```

**API keys**: the legacy single channel uses credentials reference `newapi`. Additional channels use `newapi_<provider>`; for example, provider `api-example-com` uses `newapi_api_example_com`. Enter each key in the selected channel's web settings page. Keys are resolved per request and are never echoed by the plugin.

**Generation protocols**: `protocol: chat-completions` is the backward-compatible default and sends `POST {baseURL}/chat/completions` with Bearer auth. `protocol: responses` sends `POST {baseURL}/responses` and translates Responses SSE events. `protocol: anthropic-messages` sends `POST {baseURL}/messages` with `x-api-key` and `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`, serializing tool calls as Anthropic `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks. Keep `baseURL` at the gateway root (normally ending in `/v1`); a pasted `/chat/completions`, `/responses`, or `/messages` suffix is normalized away.

**Model discovery**: `GET {baseURL}/models` for all generation protocols. The gateway listing has no reliable capability flags, so embedding / rerank / ranker families are filtered by naming convention (configurable).

**Vision models**: mark a catalog entry with `input: [text, image]` when that upstream model accepts image attachments. The adapter reads the durable dsh attachment bytes and sends a provider-native data URL for Chat Completions, `input_image` for Responses, or a base64 `image` source block for Anthropic Messages. Models without `image` remain text-only. This capability declaration also lets `dsh-sight` leave the original attachment in the request instead of replacing it with a local Windows path.

**Multiple channels**: set `channels` to register several gateways at once. Each entry gets an independent provider route, model catalog, protocol, and credential reference (`newapi` for the legacy route, otherwise `newapi_<provider>`). The web settings page lets you switch channels from the top dropdown; when a URL is pasted, the hostname fills Provider ID and display name until the user edits either field.

**Repository**: install from [zhyRRrr/dsh-llm-newapi](https://github.com/zhyRRrr/dsh-llm-newapi). Before pushing updates, run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`; commit generated `lib/` output, but do not commit local `verification` backups or machine-specific settings files.

**Web settings page**: discovered at runtime by dsh web through the `dsh.client` manifest (`ClientModuleRegistry` scans composition plugin lines), contributing a `settings.section` slot (dsh contract: features own their settings page, no shell changes). Note it is a standalone "NewAPI" page in the settings panel, not embedded inside the official Models page. Inputs and buttons all use `--dsw-alias-*` design tokens (same recipe as the official Models page), adapting automatically to light / dark themes.

**Config validation**: the settings write point rejects segments the adapter cannot serve (e.g. non-http(s) baseURL, empty filter entries) — constraints the schema cannot express are reported at write time, so you never get "saved successfully but silently kept old values".

## Release flow (prerelease → manual confirmation → stable)

- **Prerelease**: write the `package.json` version as `X.Y.Z-rc.N` and push tag `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`. After the full four gates (build / plugin-check / boot / release): the GitHub Release is marked **Pre-release** and npm publishes to the **`next`** dist-tag (`latest` untouched). Install: `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-llm-newapi@next`.
- **Promote to stable** (manual confirmation): Actions → CI → Run workflow → fill in `rc_tag` (e.g. `v0.8.2-rc.1`). The promote job verifies that rc's CI is fully green and the stable tag is unoccupied, then creates `vX.Y.Z` on the same commit — which automatically runs the stable release (full Release + npm `latest`). The GitHub `latest` tag is moved to the same commit, so `github:wenzetan/dsh-llm-newapi#latest` always resolves to the newest confirmed stable.
- Any tag with a `-` suffix is treated as a prerelease; stable tags are created exclusively by promote, so `latest` is always a manually confirmed version.

## Build & test (development in this repo)

```sh
npm install && npm run build   # host: tsc types + esbuild → lib/index.js; client: closure-factory → lib/client.js
npm test                       # cordis real-mount smoke: registration surface + chat-only filter + fiber release
npm run cache:models-dev      # cache models.dev/api.json locally to .cache/ (gitignored, for development)
```

**models.dev dev cache**: `.cache/models-dev.api.json` is not committed; it lets you inspect the real field shapes in the catalog (`limit.context/output`, `reasoning_options`) during development; when the optional smoke block detects it, real data validates `matchModelsDev` (skipped when missing, CI unaffected). Refreshing tries direct access to models.dev first, then the `HTTPS_PROXY` env var; when both are unreachable it synthesizes a subset snapshot from the GitHub source (sst/models.dev model TOML) and marks `_source`.

After changing source, re-run `npm run build` and **commit `lib/`** — `github:` installs run from the committed artifacts, and the CI "Committed artifacts are current" step rejects stale outputs.

## Status

v0.8.3: tool-call id/name delta hardening (#1) — some gateways (glm-5.3 via qcplay) repeat `tool_calls[].id` and `function.name` on every continuation delta as **empty strings** instead of omitting the fields; the presence-only merge overwrote the first delta's real tool name with `''`, so every tool call failed as `unknown tool`. The translator now accepts only non-empty `id`/`name` values (matching the existing non-empty guards on text/reasoning deltas); argument concatenation is unchanged.

v0.8.1: preset reasoning effort — the effort field in a model row's advanced area is now a dropdown, letting users set one level as default (`defaultReasoningEffort` persisted); when nothing is preset, the **highest** declared level is used by default (max>xhigh>high>medium>low>…); `resolveModel` declares `defaultEffort` and the composer auto-selects that level when switching reasoning modes. Write validation: the preset must belong to that model's effort list.

v0.8.0: parameter-matching engine rework — **built-in family hints + approximate-key matching + configurable overrides**. Built-in family defaults (glm→zai, gpt→openai, claude→anthropic, deepseek→deepseek, gemini→google, grok→xai, qwen→alibaba, kimi→moonshotai, mimo→xiaomi, minimax→minimax, hunyuan→tencent) put the official entry first and mark it "official" among candidates; **approximate keys** are supported inside the official vendor (when the catalog lacks that exact version, take the closest family entry, e.g. glm-5.3→zai's glm-5); no cross-vendor approximation to avoid noise; `providerHints` config can override/extend (`defaults` family prefix + `models` per-id exact, per-id takes precedence). Order: hinted official → exact key (catalog order) → registry official supplement. Measured: 22 models, 20 resolved directly to official (including real reasoning efforts); qwen27b-coder has no match (id absent from the catalog); tencent/Hunyuan-MT-7B falls to nano-gpt (official tencent has no such model).

v0.7.2: "Clear" button in the model catalog title row — same semantics as per-row delete, removes all model rows at once; resets expanded state, capacity input buffers and the parameter results panel; disabled when the catalog is empty; saving writes an empty `models` array.

v0.7.1: parameter matching prefers official by default — when multiple vendors match, the official vendor's entry is put first and marked "official" (the panel defaults to item 0, i.e. the official parameters); the authoritative source is the built-in model catalogs of other routes in the dsh-llm registry (e.g. the deepseek route declares deepseek-v4-flash, so api.json uses the deepseek vendor entry), matched by bare model id (multi-segment ids look up the last segment); the index rebuilds automatically when the route set changes.

v0.7.0: display-name generation supports brand spelling (glm→GLM, gpt→GPT, deepseek→DeepSeek), multi-segment ids append the raw prefix in parentheses (`deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash`→`DeepSeek V4 Flash[deepseek-ai]`), size-suffix uppercasing limited to b/k/m (`gpt-4o` keeps lowercase o); **end-to-end reasoning effort** — "Fetch model info from models.dev" now also brings in the effort list from `reasoning_options` (null dropped), stored in the catalog's `reasoningEfforts` field, `resolveModel` declares selectable reasoning efforts from it (the composer shows an effort selector), an explicit effort goes on the wire via the OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_effort` field; the row's advanced area shows it read-only, and the results panel + provider selector display it in sync.

v0.6.3: the fetch-model adoption chain is sorted by id end to end — the candidate list is re-sorted client-side after pulling (not dependent on the host-side version); after "Add selected", the form rows merge into one alphabetical list (old and new rows sorted together); half-formed rows with empty ids sink to the bottom.

v0.6.2: fetch-model auto-generates display names — when the gateway listing has no name, derive one from the id: multi-segment ids keep only the content after the last `/`, `-` becomes a space, each word's first letter is capitalized, trailing single-letter size suffixes are uppercased (`qwen3-32b`→Qwen3 32B, `glm-4.5-air`→Glm 4.5 Air, `llama-3.1-70b`→Llama 3.1 70B); names provided by the listing still win.

v0.6.1: proxy control simplified — the preset dropdown is gone, leaving a single text field whose default and placeholder are both `http://127.0.0.1:7890` (saving an empty value falls back to that default).

v0.6.0: parameter results panel rearranged — the model id is a fixed 30ch text field (left-aligned; oversized content scrolls horizontally on hover so row alignment no longer drifts), and the right-side mapping column is explicitly left-aligned; "Fetch model info from models.dev" now gives immediate feedback: the status line shows "matched N · unmatched M" counts, and the results panel auto-scrolls into view (long model lists no longer push the panel off-screen).

v0.5.8: action copy changed to "Fetch model info from models.dev"; fixed the misleading failure hint — when the proxy is on but the proxy itself is unreachable (ECONNREFUSED), the old message wrongly suggested "enable the proxy"; now it distinguishes by actual route: proxy-path failures name "proxy at <url> is unreachable; check that it is running, or change or disable the proxy setting", and only direct-path failures suggest enabling the proxy.

v0.5.7: fixed the published package's type entry — declaration emit left a `.ts` specifier (`rewriteRelativeImportExtensions` does not apply to d.ts), breaking consumer type resolution; the host build now rewrites relative `.ts` to `.js` in `lib/types/*.d.ts`. Added `prepack` script. CI gained the dsh-plugin-check compliance gate (manifest protocol / patch format / build pitfalls; verdict must pass; this repo went from fail to green).

v0.5.6: fixed "Update model info" HTTP 500 — download failures (models.dev unreachable directly, dead proxy, etc.) previously threw, which the transport layer mapped to an opaque 500; the handler now returns an error envelope and the settings page shows the underlying cause directly (DNS / refused / timeout) with the "enable proxy" hint. Also fixed the dual-undici issue on the proxy path: npm undici's ProxyAgent is rejected by Node's built-in fetch brand check, so proxy requests now go through npm undici's own fetch.

v0.5.4: CI boot gate stabilized — the runner installs pnpm (the profile plugin flow depends on it; a bare runner lacked it, making the gate fail on first run); the three gate assertions (:3080 ready, client bundle 200, RPC channel not 405) are green end-to-end on tag builds.

v0.5.3: fixed undici missing from production installs — undici previously sat in both dependencies and devDependencies, and `--omit=dev` installs (the CI self-containment gate's clean directory) dropped the same-named devDep wholesale instead of falling back to the prod declaration, making the bundled output unresolvable in isolation; removing it from devDependencies turned the CI gate green. CI gained a boot gate: install dsh globally → fresh DSH_HOME installs the tarball via `dsh plugin add` → start `dsh web` in the background, requiring :3080 ready, `/plugins/dsh-llm-newapi/client.js` retrievable, and `/llm-newapi/models-dev-params` not 405.

v0.5.2: fixed "Update model info" HTTP 405 — the RPC channel previously read `ctx.get('connection')` eagerly in apply, silently skipping registration when the plugin mounted before the web app started the connection service (got `undefined`); it now uses `ctx.inject(['connection'], …)` to register once the service is ready (re-run automatically on service reload), and a smoke scenario pins the "plugin mounts first, service starts later" ordering.

v0.5.1: undici moved from peerDependencies into dependencies (the host does not provide undici; under `autoInstallPeers: false` unresolved peers made the whole plugin tree fail to load); CI gained a self-containment gate — `npm pack` output is unpacked into a clean directory installing production deps only, and every non-host-provided bare import in the host bundle must resolve.

v0.5: discovery results sorted by id; display names for `a/b`-shaped ids take the last segment (wire id unchanged); new "Update model info" — the browser sends model ids (and the proxy draft) to the host via the RPC (`/llm-newapi` channel), the backend downloads `https://models.dev/api.json` and matches by id/last segment, returning `limit.context`/`limit.output`; same-name multi-vendor entries are chosen by the user in the results panel; applying supports "overwrite" or "fill blanks only", unmatched rows keep their values with a count hint. Proxy toggle off by default, default `http://127.0.0.1:7890`, three preset dropdown entries 7890/7897/10809 plus custom input; enabled state and address persist with the settings section (used only for that download; gateway traffic does not go through the proxy).

v0.4: model catalog redesigned after the official Models page (`ModelListEditor`) — each model is a bordered card (id + display name inline), context window / max output collapsed behind the leading chevron, with K/M shorthand input (`256K`→256000, `1M`→1000000) and per-field input buffers; local validation before saving (empty id / duplicate id / unparseable capacity are rejected and the row named); empty-state hint and pill "Add model" button; deleting rows re-aligns expanded state and buffers by row number.

v0.3: API key moved to pure front-end configuration (fixed credentials reference `newapi`; removed the `apiKeyEnv` config and env fallback); settings page uses `--dsw-alias-*` design tokens, adapting to light/dark themes; settings write point gained validate rejection; `WireAssistantMessage.content` type tightened to `string`. The dual-face structure (host adapter + chat-only-filtered discovery, browser NewAPI settings page) is unchanged; typecheck / build / smoke all green; artifacts committed + CI sync check + Release tarball. Known npm rc gap stubbed via overrides (see DESIGN §8).
