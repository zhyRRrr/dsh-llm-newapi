 * Decode an SSE byte stream into event `data` payloads. Framing — chunk

 * only through an optional transport-activity callback. This module keeps
 * the gateway protocol: the literal `[DONE]` is yielded so the caller owns
 * final flushing, and EOF before it raises {@link LlmError}. Framing is
 * spec-strict: an event dispatches only on its blank-line terminator, so an
 * unterminated tail at EOF is truncation, not a flushable payload.
